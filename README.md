A repo for storing everything related to data structures and algorithms for interview preparation and general learning. Solutions to every problem I solve, as well as everything regarding patterns, any tips and tricks, notes, resources.

This aims to keep everything contained, reinforce learning, and make it easier to revisit topics in the future.
